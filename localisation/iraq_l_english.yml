POLITICS_SADDAM_HUSSEIN_DESC:0 "Saddam Hussein, the President of the 1st Iraqi Republic, is a man of many years and many days. Since the days of his youth and the ability for him to gain education despite a poor background, Saddam was infatuated with ideals of Liberlism and Democracy despite growing up in a rural and Sunni enviroment. Saddam would refine his rough edges at a yound age, being a powerful intellectual and impassioned speaker. Saddam would fall in with the July 14th movement on their protests, being wounded in the shots that were sprayed into the crowds by the Armies of the Golden Square, Saddam became a dedicated revolutionary democrat. Soon Saddam would rise to the spearhead of the call for liberty, the face of the voice of the rising masses. Soon Saddams time would come as he officially became the head of the July 14th movement, the spearhead of the peoples fist soon rising up and driving a stake through the vile heart of the Golden Square, establishing a multiparty democracy in its place, the Iraqi Republic. Saddam was of course not only the head of the interim government but also elected head of the new Republic off of his history in the revolution and his espousal for Iraqi neutrality and nationalism, his party, the Free National Party, winning a clear majority in the new parliament with Saddam as Presidential head of the new state. In his many years in office, Saddam would mend ties between Kurds and Arabs, establish womens suffrage, universal education, establish true secularization and freedom of religion, all while maintaining a rather nationalistic character with an emphasis on historical unity rather than cultural, ethnic, or linguistic. Saddam's leadership abilities, along with a rather strongman attitude with his policies while maintaining democracy, made him the most beloved leader in moder Iraq's short history, but perhaps what is most surprising about the President of Iraq is his continuos string of electoral victories for nearly 60 years. The opposition challenges Saddam by saying that he has rigged at least one of them, but the truth is saddams near 60 year tenure in office has been compltely legitimate, but Saddam is less than thrilled with the long life of his political career. Saddam, a tired old man growing into his 80's, lacks the fiery spirit of his younger years, his youthfeel energy and optimism replaced by the crushing realities of age, Saddam is in desperate need of retirement, his government knows it, his people knows it, he knows it. After the long life of politics, Saddam simply wishes to retire with silent dignity and spen his remaining years out of the forefront of national politics. Saddam has merely been holding out until he thought he could go no more, still thinking of his people above himself, still pushing on day by day towards the next session of parliament. But the fact is, Saddam is not the young Liberal he once was, now he is simply an old man looking to see himself rest after the immense efforts of a strenuos lifetime."
