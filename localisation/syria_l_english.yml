Hilal_desc:0 "Hilal Hilal is the undisputed master of Syria. Many compare him to the dictators of old, and while the likes of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini do not fit the likeness of the face of the Ba'ath party, the undoubtable inspiration he has taken from them is well shown in his policies. The President of Syria forever remains vigilant for any attempt to expand his Arab State, waiting and watching in the shadows of international politics. The man rose to his position off the back of the popular revolution, which he now uses as a mere propaganda tool. The most powerful man in Syria displays his military might across the Arab World, boasting his power and triumph to all of the 'False Imperialist States' that surround him. His Iron grip and never ending propaganda machine wage a constant war for the popular support he enjoys, his position within his party and nation are never questioned, his continuos and absolute control over Syria is an undisputed reality which shall continue to be brought up in the numerous state run Televised programs and party run Newspapers. The Father of the Revolution, as his personality cult has called him, stands tall as the President of Syria, and if he has his way, the President of All Arabs"

syr.1.t:0 "The Unanswered Question"
syr.1.d:0 "President Hilal paced up and down, with slow and soft steps gracing the vibrant emerald green carpets that lined the floor of his office. His face curled into a constant scowl, his mind wandering and his physical status that of apathy. He paced and paced, until he came to rest in one spot, his mind still filled with the same troublesome thoughts as always. The foot stacks of papers his desk was always filled with continued to play into his thoughts, his contemplation seemingly neverending. His thoughts rested on one thing, and one thing alone. His mind toiled over one simple question, one answer that seemed to never be given. As he pondered the answer to this question, his mind turned to all he had done, all of the mortar and bricks he had used to build this nation. He and he alone was what held the nation together, him and all of those loyal to him, Hilal knew this. The Syrian Stringman had always known, and always would know, that ever since he took up this position that he and he alone would be the glue that held the Arabs of this nation together, and that was always a thought burned into his head with every document he signed and every decision he made. This knowledge only made the question he pondered sound even more like a fearful choking plea. As he uttered 5 simple words that continued to trouble him as he felt the constant looming fear of death push in his mind, the impressed question finally was breathed into the world as Hilal continued to ponder."
